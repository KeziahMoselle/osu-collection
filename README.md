__The cloud for replays__

This is a project I had the idea to do in order to deepen my knowledge, I thought it might be useful to some players.

## Features

* Sign up / Log in
* Upload a replay
* Public or Private
* Manage your replays (View all your replays, delete them)

## Features i want to implement

* Edit a replay
* Add Favorites
* Add Download count
* Add Leaderboard
* Add a Youtube link
* Add some cool badges

## Problems encountered

  * I can't fetch replay data (Like the name, maxcombo, mods etc..) So i add an input "beatmap_id" to fetch the data.
